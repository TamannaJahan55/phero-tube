              <p>var: The scope of variables declared with var
                Variables declared with var can have a global or local scope. Global scope is for variables declared outside functions, while local scope is for variables declared inside functions.
                Variables declared with var can be re-declared and reassigned.
                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their global or local scope, which makes them accessible before the line they are declared.
                <br>
                <br>
                let: Variables declared with let can have a global, local, or block scope. Block scope is for variables declared in a block. A block in JavaScript involves opening and closing curly braces.
                Just like var, variables declared with let can be reassigned to other values, but they cannot be re-declared.
                Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope.
                <br>
                <br>
                const: Variables declared with const are similar to let in regards to scope. Such variables can have a global, local, or block scope.
                const is used for declaring constant variables - which are variables with values that cannot be changed. So such variables cannot be re-declared, and neither can they be reassigned to other values.
                Variables declared with const, just like let, are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope - but without a default initialization.

              <p>null: 1. Null means an empty value or a blank value.
                       2. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
                       3. It converts to 0 then performs the operation.
                       4. As we assign null to a variable, it is an assignment value.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                undefined: 1. Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
                           2. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable.
                           3. It returns NaN on performing arithmetic operations.
                           4. As there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined.

                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p>API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
                <br>
                <br>
                REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
